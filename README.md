# babsi-js

> Babsi is a fast, lightweight and new concept lazy loading image, it aim to load images when entering in viewport. It use Webassembly to decode WebP* and relies on IntersectionObserver on top.

Babsi-js is a personal project for future, i need my own lazy loading library to use with my own future CMS. It can be used alone itself too.

## Is this already usable?
No, still WIP. On example there's some working but still missing main feature ( WebP decoder Wasm is present, but there's some low stack problem )

## Uh? Another lazy loading library using IntersectionObserver?
Yeah, but works in a unique way. It do not replace only data-src with src when viewport enter. It draw canvas to draw image got by XMLHttpRequest. Images should be provided only in WebP also on un-supported browser due the fact it embed decoder ( same used in Chrome ) itself. Fast thanks Webassembly.

## WebP polyfill?
Nope, this is not a slow polyfill, image will render as native image. Babsi use [webmproject/libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp) native code. It's C based, so nothing like JS-based performance.

## No IntersectionObserver polyfill?
Currently no. Not needed but in my TODO.

## TODO
| Feature                 | Status                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| IntersectionObserver Polyfill | Missing |
| WebP Decoder | Partially Working* |
| Better default animation | WIP |
| Better handle of http queue | Missing |
|  |  |

*It is included and functions is correctly working, working wrapper, now missing logic to covert image blob to uInt8, and decode the output in format uInt8 r1, g1, b1, a1, r2, g2, ...

## Usage

```js
const BabsiJs = require('babsi-js');

const babsiJs = new BabsiJs();
// script
```

```html
<script src="build/index.js"></script>
<script>
var babsi = new Babsi({
  querySelector: 'img'
});
if (!babsi.checkCompatibility()) {
  console.log('[!] Babsi is not compatible');
}
</script>
```
